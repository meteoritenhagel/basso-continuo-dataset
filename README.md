# basso-continuo-dataset
Repository containing exemplary pieces containing basso continuo parts in MusicXML formats.

Even though there has been a little work in music information retrieval (MIR)
dealing with figured bass, including

 1. the generation of figures from an unfigured piece,
 2. generation of a realization of figured bass,

there is only one dataset for usecase 1. (namely
https://github.com/juyaolongpaul/Bach_chorale_FB),
but for usecase 2. there is to my knowledge not a single standard dataset for this task.
For the development and comparison of figured bass realizations, such a dataset
is absolutely necessary.

While there are some online corpora containing figured bass pieces, for example
 * https://github.com/DCMLab/dcml_corpora which contains the trio sonatas
Op. 1-4 by Arcangelo Corelli
 * https://tobis-notenarchiv.de/ e.g. with songs from Schemellis Gesangbuch under https://tobis-notenarchiv.de/wp/bach-archiv/lieder-arien-und-quodlibet/geistliche-lieder-und-arien-aus-schemellis-gesangbuch/

they usually encompass very few of them and in different formatting.

This repo aims to build a bigger dataset of pieces containing figured bass all in one place.

The following pieces have been added:

| Composer | Piece | Filename | Contributor | Reviewed |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|----------|
|          |       |          |             |          |
