# basso-continuo-dataset
Repository containing exemplary pieces containing basso continuo parts in MusicXML formats.

Even though there has been a little work in music information retrieval (MIR)
dealing with figured bass, including

 1. the generation of figures from an unfigured piece,
 2. generation of a realization of figured bass,

there is only one dataset for usecase 1. (namely
https://github.com/juyaolongpaul/Bach_chorale_FB),
but for usecase 2. there is to my knowledge not a single standard dataset for this task.
For the development and comparison of figured bass realizations, such a dataset
is absolutely necessary.

While there are some online corpora containing figured bass pieces, for example

 * https://github.com/DCMLab/dcml_corpora which contains the trio sonatas
Op. 1-4 by Arcangelo Corelli
 * https://tobis-notenarchiv.de/ (e.g. with songs from Schemellis Gesangbuch)

they usually have some problems:
 * they encompass very little basso continuo works,
 * with very different formattings (e.g. not using the figured bass MusicXML tags but text tags for figures),
 * they are not usable under MIT license.

This repo aims to build a dataset
 * of many basso continuo pieces of different styles and epochs,
 * all in one place,
 * with unified formatting for easier computer-based processing,
 * published under the MIT license.

The following pieces have already been added:
